# Extension "Freiburg Sex-Estimation" for RDFBones-O
This is an extension for the sex estimation of adults utilising cranial and mandibular traits. The Freiburg method of sex estimation (abbr. FrSexEst) is a morphological method based on the scoring system developed in Acsádi & Nemeskéri 1970 and adjusted in Ferembach et al. 1979. The evaluated traits and their respective weight in the calculation of the degreee of sexualisation are according to Ferembach et al. 1979 except for the zygomatic arch which is evaluated additionaly and the frontal inclination of the skull which is not part of FrSexEst.

The ten cranial and four mandibular traits (cf. Assays) of FrSexEst were used in the sex estimation of skulls from the Alexander-Ecker-Collection in Freiburg. Thus, the collected data from the Alexander-Ecker-Collection can be digitized and made accessible for future research within the flexible RDFBones-Ontology. Of course, the Freiburg method of sex estimation can be applied to estimate the sex of any human skull.
