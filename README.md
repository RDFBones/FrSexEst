#Extension “Freiburg Sex Estimation” for RDFBones-O
##Anthropological background
This is an extension for the sex estimation of adults utilising cranial and mandibular traits. The Freiburg method of sex estimation (abbr. FrSexEst) is a morphological method based on the scoring system developed by Acsádi & Nemeskéri 1970 and adjusted by Ferembach et al. 1979. The evaluated traits and their respective weights (in brackets) in the calculation of the degree of sexualization are as follows:


###Cranium:

•	Glabella (3)

•	Mastoid process (3)

•	Nuchal planum (3)

•	Zygomatic process (3)

•	Superciliary arch (2)

•	Frontal and parietal eminences (2)

•	Zygomatics (2)

•	Supramastoid crest (2)

•	External occipital protuberance (2)

•	Orbital aperture (1)


###Mandible:

•	Mandible as a whole (3)

•	Mental protuberance (2)

•	Gonial angle (2)

•	Mylohyoid line (1)


These traits (regarded as “assays” in the framework of RDFBones) and their respective weights are in general according to Ferembach et al. 1979 except for the frontal inclination of the skull and the supraorbital margin which are not part of FrSexEst.
These ten cranial and four mandibular traits of FrSexEst were used in the sex estimation of skulls from the Alexander-Ecker-Collection in Freiburg (for further information on the Alexander-Ecker-Collection cf. Kästner et al. 2011). Thus, the collected data from the Alexander-Ecker-Collection can be digitized and made accessible for future research within the flexible RDFBones ontology by means of this extension. 
The Freiburg method of sex estimation can be applied to estimate the sex of any human skull, of course. By adding the frontal inclination and the supraorbital margin, another extension can easily be created which is then fully congruent with Ferembach et al. 1979.

##Wiki index
The Wiki for FrSexEst is a thorough online documentation of the FrSexEst ontology (https://github.com/RDFBones/FrSexEst/wiki). This Wiki should satisfy two objectives at once. On the one hand, the Wiki contains further information about the extension itself (mostly network graphs) and some general tips for writing extensions to make FrSexEst understandable and a valuable resource for programmers interested in writing their own extensions.  On the other hand, it explicates the workflow of a FrSexEst investigation for anthropologists interested in carrying out sex estimations accordingly and archiving research data. The Wiki provides further information on the following topics:


•	General structure of FrSexEst

•	Investigation planning

•	Study design execution

•	Drawing a conclusion

•	General tips for extension writing
